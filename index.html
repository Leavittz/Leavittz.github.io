          <h2>My Passions</h2>
          <p>
            My Passion is to create solutions to problems. I'm sure many have said that but I mean it in a much broader context than web dev. My goal is to eventually help out with advanced medical robotics and devices!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll be happy to create solutions for you in the meantime though! You just might be as suprised as I am about my capailities.
          </p>
          <p>I love learning more than any other activity when it applies to my goals in even a remote and distant way.</p>
